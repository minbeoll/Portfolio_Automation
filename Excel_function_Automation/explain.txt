A column — Contains the list of currently registered companies in the KOSPI stock market.

VP column — Represents raw data from October 24, which includes companies I plan to register in my stock tracking material.

GN column — Using Excel formulas, I compared the A column with the VP column and extracted the distinct companies into this column.

This allows me to track the flow of stock values, especially observing when certain stocks gradually increase in price.
